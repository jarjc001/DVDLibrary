"# DVD_Library" 
"# DVDLibrary" 
In this activity, you will create a program that stores information about a DVD collection. The program must do the following:

    Allow the user to add a DVD to the collection
    Allow the user to remove a DVD from the collection
    Allow the user to edit the information for an existing DVD in the collection
    Allow the user to list the DVDs in the collection
    Allow the user to display the information for a particular DVD
    Allow the user to search for a DVD by title
    Load the DVD library from a file
    Save the DVD library back to the file when the program completes
    Allow the user to add, edit, or delete many DVDs in one session

Additionally, the program must follow the MVC design pattern and use dependency injection as shown in the course material.

You should follow the process outlined in the Agile Approach Checklist for Console Applications document elsewhere in this course.

Your DVD data transfer object should have the following fields:

    Title
    Release date
    MPAA rating
    Director's name
    Studio
    User rating or note (allows the user to enter additional information, e.g., "Good family movie")
